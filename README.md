      <p id="message"> Hello Viewers,</p><p>My name is Khandker Shabnan Habib, who is enlisted in the Talented and Gifted School for young scholars in Manhattan. I am origninally from Bangaldesh, and currently live in the Bronx of New York. I am enjoying coding and wish to learn more about computer programming. I take educcation very seriously, and am hoping to pursue careers which involve computer science, or code. I have involved myself by attending school classes, attempting to make businesses, and have work relentlessly to better my coding skills. It is now that I am able to make a difference and start considering my future. I think to myslef that if people were able to make the computers that I am using now, the websites which I access every single day, I bet that I can code, as well.</p>
      
      <p>My introduction will be modified later, and I will fix the things that must be fixed. This bio may seem to be very boring, but to me, it is something that I can refer to all the time, and remind myslef that I do know how to code, and that no one can stop me once I have started. In the meantime, how about checking about my website that I made on the Weebly Online Editor to help my classmates with homework problems. Click <a href="http://www.taghomework.weebly.com">here</a> if you are interested.</p>
      
      <p id="messi" title="Messi is the Greatest">Oh and I forgot to mention, but if you are wondering what my physical appearance is, look at the photo below! JK (Just Kidding!) I am, as of now, quite weary of the way I look. By the way, I really don't want to be stalked or tracked, or anything invloving a breach of personal privacy. For that reason, I will show a picture of my idol, who in fact, is well known around the world, but surprisingly not for code, but for his sports achievements. You might know who this man is. He currently stands at an astonishing 5 feet 7 inches. For someone that small, you wouldn't expect him to carry Barcelona and the Argentina national team. But he does! <hr><br>
